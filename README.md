# Python-Practice
Me practicing/strengthening my knowledge on Python

Overall I had basic knowledge of Python. My overall perception was that it was a begineer language for programmers to learn
then they would migrate to more mainstream languages like Java and C++. After a discussion with a friend on how Python was 
more than just a simple scripting language, it's a powerful tool that can be used as great as the other languages mentioned
above. To learn more about Python I challenged my self to read Tony Gaddis' book "Starting Out With Python" to not only good
theoretical knowledge but a practical one as well. Not only was I just reading throught the chapters but I decided to complete
the many programming projects at the end of each chapter to reinforced what I learned. I undoubtedly became not only a better
programmer in Python but overall a better programmer.
